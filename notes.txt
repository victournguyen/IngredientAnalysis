data processing
- convert to correct data types
	-- make category into a factor
- remove vitamin d (last observation)
- rename columns to not have spaces (easier to handle)
- create broad categories

purpose
- investigate relationships between amounts of various nutrients

3 new vars
- make groups of amounts of b12 (factor)
- broader categories
	-- dairy/fatty, meat, fruits/veg/plants, other
- sum of vitamins

univar plots
- bar plot of broad category
- histogram of b12, copper, zinc, water, total lipids

multivar plots
- groups of b12, bar plot by broad category
- b12 vs copper, b12 vs zinc, b6 vs copper, b6 vs zinc
	-- display in 2 rows of 2 plots
	-- iron and zinc are pos cor to b6 and b12, copper to b12 but not b6?
- total lipids vs water, fiber vs water, total lipids vs fiber
	-- color by broad category (could use RColorBrewer or ggplot2)
- boxplots for sum of vitamins, grouped by broad category
	-- NOTE: explain the xlim()

function
- check b12 group and add
- make broader categories
- make histograms, scatter plots

for loop
- check b12 group and add

debug
- working directory
- reading console error when making graphs

checklist
- make graph titles enticing
- careful with text output in report
- past tense
- look for consistency
- make sure axis labels are correct, variables are on the correct axes
- describe where functions, ifs, and loops are
- no unwanted text overlap
- check figure output size
- add comments
- check capitalization in references (all sections)
- careful about unsupported speculation
- spell/grammar check
