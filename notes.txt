data processing
- convert to correct data types
	-- make category into a factor
- remove vitamin d (last observation)
- rename columns to not have spaces (easier to handle)
- create broad categories
	-- there are two infant formula categories

purpose
- investigate relationships between amounts of various nutrients

3 new vars
- make groups of amounts of b12 (factor)
- broader categories
	-- dairy/fatty, meat, fruits/veg/plants, other
- sum of vitamins

univar plots
- bar plot of broad category
- histogram of b12, copper, zinc, water, total lipids

multivar plots
- groups of b12, bar plot by broad category
- b12 vs copper, b12 vs zinc, b6 vs copper, b6 vs zinc
	-- display in 2 rows of 2 plots
	-- iron and zinc are pos cor to b6 and b12, copper to b12 but not b6?
- total lipids vs water, fiber vs water, total lipids vs fiber
	-- color by broad category (could use RColorBrewer or ggplot2)
- boxplots for sum of vitamins, grouped by broad category

function
- check b12 group and add
- make broader categories

for loop
- check b12 group and add

debug
- working directory
- reading console error when making graphs
